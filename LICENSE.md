Different parts of the projects are released under different licenses. The default licensing goes like this:

* **CODE:** Released under MIT license
* **GRAPHICS & SFX:** CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
* **MUSIC & FONTS:** Not released under any license, copyrights held by the original authors
* **OTHER ASSETS:** Project files, levels fall under MIT

Keep in mind many of those are old projects made when I was a teen/young adult in the age of the internet where copyrights and licenses worked differently.

As such if you see files that should not be here reach out to me and I'll see about removing them or getting necessary permissions.
