## About
An unofficial level editor for the excellent puzzle game Hanano by
Qrostar/Tatsunami.


## How to use the editor
 - Editor runs on **Windows** and on **Linux** (through Wine)
 - Download the game from the link above
 - **Windows:** Double click `Editor.exe`
 - **Linux:** Open terminal and type `wine Editor.exe`

Once you are happy with your levels you can replace the files in the game
directory and start it to play the new levels.

**Warning!** Cancelling from the Save / Load dialog may crash the program.

`01` in the binary directory is a level but I don't know if it was made by me,
someone else or is from the game and I used it for testing.
