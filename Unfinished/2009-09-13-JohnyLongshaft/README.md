## About
Johny Longshaft was supposed to be a room-based platformer with fall damage
and that's about all I can remember about the project. It never went beyond the
prototyping stage and if I had any grand ideas about it those are lost to the
sands of time.


## How to play the prototype
 - **Windows:** Double click `play-win.bat`
 - **Linux Option A:** Right click on `play-linux.sh` and
   select *"Run As a Program"*
 - **Linux Option B:** Open terminal and type `./play-linux.sh`


## Controls
