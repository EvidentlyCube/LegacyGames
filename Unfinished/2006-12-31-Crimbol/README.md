## About
An unfinished prototype of an action game. I have very, very vague recollection
of this project. I am sure it had to do with me trying out some "cool"
terrain generation but that's about all I know. I don't believe it was ever
released in any form before.

The name is most likely a reference to Kingdom of Loathing's Crimbo but I have
no idea why.

There is a bug that I find amusing - while there is logic that ends the game
when you move out of the game area it doesn't happen when you are pushed out.
Or maybe it was intended, who can tell?
