I'm too lazy and tired to write some kind of Manual here. I just hope everything is clear enough. Btw, the mouse selection only works with the left panel, so don't try to click on the arrows on the right. The graphics of course are only for Alpha releases. In the next version I will work on it :). No sound right now, because there is no need to. REPORT EVERY ONE BUG AND EVERY ONE STRANGE THING YOU ENCOUNTER BY EITHER PM'ING ME ON FORUM, OR POSTING IT IN YHE GAME THREAD. Thanks for cooperation fella and have a nice play! (It is finishable, but there is nothing for killing all enemies alas...)
