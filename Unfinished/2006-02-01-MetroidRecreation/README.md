## About
To quote 16 year old me (mistakes kept for authenticity):

> Top down Rogue-Drod-Metroidlike turn pseudo-rpg game. There will be
Metroid-like skills (Beams, armours, turbos, jump power, Morph Ball,
SPider Ball, and Few More...), put in Drod game system with very few RPG elements.


## How to play the game
There is currently no way - the project does not work as-is and it's been too
long for me to want to figure it out.
