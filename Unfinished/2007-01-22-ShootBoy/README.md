## About
An unfinished prototype of a survival space shooter. I was exploring the
capabilities of Game Maker's surfaces (temporary, dynamically generated sprites)
and had the idea of using it to create randomly generated terrain as an
obstacle for a space shooter.

The game has a lot of unfinished systems and I don't really remember any
additional details about what it was supposed to be.
