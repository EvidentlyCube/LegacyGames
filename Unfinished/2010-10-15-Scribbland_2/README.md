# Scribbland 2

 - **Last Update Date:** October 15, 2010
 - **Status:** Abandoned game prototype
 - **Technology:** Flash (.fla project)


## About
A planned sequel to Scribbland. The gameplay was much more involved with many
additional features and I never decided whether I wanted the game to be single
button like the original or normal platformer or both.


## How to play the game
 - **Windows:** Double click `play-win.bat`
 - **Linux Option A:** Right click on `play-linux.sh` and
   select *"Run As a Program"*
 - **Linux Option B:** Open terminal and type `./play-linux.sh`


## Controls
 - `Arrows` ⟶ Move
 - `Z` ⟶ Jump
