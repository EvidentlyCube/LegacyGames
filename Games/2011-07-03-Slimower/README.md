# Development
## Project Structure
 - `Media/` ⟶ Social media and web assets
 - `Source_AS3/` ⟶ The game's source files
 - `SWF/` ⟶ A compiled `.swf` file of the game
 - `play-win.bat` ⟶ A windows batch file that runs the SWF file in
   a bundled flash player
 - `play-linux.sh` ⟶ A shell script that runs the SWF file in
   a bundled flash player
 - `archive_filelist.txt` ⟶ Contents listing of the archive that contained the

## Trivia
 - Name of the game is a portmanteau of "slime" and "to mow".
 - The source code had a bunch of framework files missing and it required
   digging through other projects of the era to get those files.
