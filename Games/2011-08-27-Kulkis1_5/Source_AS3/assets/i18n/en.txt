intro1=In the last chamber he was greeted by the smiling face of a Kulkis... A Kulkis who had left their tribe long ago and now, apparently, came back! A strange words left his mouth: "Quite a good specimen, I will call him Sthirv for now. Now, let's continue the experiment" and then everything became blurry...
intro2=...After a moment of darkness our Kulkis woke up, bouncing uncontrollably, in another strange room. "Was he talking about me?" He thought, and moved forward, hoping to find his answers.

midtro7=While moving through a series of corridors connecting chambers, Sthirv fell deep in thought. "What does he want from me? I long to see my family, to see the sun." He had no idea...
midtro13=As he was about to enter next chamber, a loud voice echoed through the corridors. "Congratulations specimen Sthirv!" The voice had a pleasant, hypnotic vibe to it. "You are halfway of your experiment session. You are the last to survive." This made him think, but before he had a chance to do anything, the air movement forced him into a next room.
midtro19=Finally, a break between chambers, a long corridor with a light at its end, gave him a chance to try something. "What did you mean by 'last to survive'?" After few seconds, an answer came. "I could have meant, that you are last of your kind, couldn't have I? Perhaps something else? Don't think too much little ball, your answers are closer than you think." Then a loud, high-pitched screech pierced filled the air. He felt pushed towards the light.

outro1=Finally, Sthirv entered the longest, vertical corridor. With no ledge to bounce from, he was forced to move down into the dark abyss. Wanting to gather his thoughts, he slowed down as much as possible.
outro2="Am I really the last of my kind? What about this... my oppressor?  He looked like he was a Kulkis too!" He whispered to himself, frowning. "But there was something strange about him. I felt power from him, as if... I know our kind has powerful mind abilities but even if you gather all Kulkises you won't be able to manipulate the planet this much! It's impossible he is bending gravity to his own will!"
outro3=Then he noticed that the corridor is opening into a big room, with the Black Kulkis happily jumping around some strange levers and button. "Finally!" He said looking at the descending Sthirv. "I think you are ready to evolve." He added with a smile, only minutes separating the two from meeting.
