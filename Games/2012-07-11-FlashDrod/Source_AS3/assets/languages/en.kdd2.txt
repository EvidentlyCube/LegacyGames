# Level entrances
entr5=Beethro Budkin, fifth-generation professional dungeon exterminator, was hired by King Dugan to clear the king's multi-level dungeon of a large monster infestation.///
    Beethro charges by the room, and as a professional, he is contract-bound to clear all the monsters from each and every room in the dungeon to get paid.///
    The only weapon Beethro needs to do his job is a Really Big Sword, which will defeat almost any monster in a single hit.////
    -----////
    The last level left Beethro sweating. "I guess this is going to be hard work after all." Fortunately, there was a cool breeze coming from the next level.
entr6=Perhaps the level architect was trying too hard to make his point, whatever that point was. In any case, you can be thankful that there are no other levels in Dugan's Dungeon like this one.
entr6Back=Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
entr7=As Beethro climbed down the stairs he heard a loud hissing. As a seasoned professional, he knew instantly what it was, but was still startled by the sheer volume.  "Jeebus!  How many of those nasty things are down there?"
entr8=Some monsters are cunning and lethal, and others are just a horrible pain to clean up after.
entrMaster=Beethro descended the stairs only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...////
    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.
entrTut=Tutorial
entrTutLeave=Beethro left the tutorial floor rich with new knowledge.
entrPremaster=Beethro stumbled up and down a series of poorly-lit staircases. "This is a safety hazard and there aren't even any roaches in here! Someone oughta at least put a handrail or s-" thought Beethro right before he fell twelve flights and knocked himself out for a solid hour. After dreaming horrible, horrible dreams about eyeball pudding, Beethro groggily awakened in a room. "Gob! Would it be so hard to have these places be on the map for once?"

scT4=`Escape` opens up the pause menu, where you can view `General Help` to refer to the controls any time you wish.

# Speeches
sp5e1=This is a tutorial area.
sp5e2=Visit it if you haven't played this game before.
sp5e3=Move around using the numpad or 789, UIO, JKL
sp52n1=Clearing this place without any of those doors opening would be something to brag about.
sp52n2=Ha! Sloppy dungeon design, putting in unnecessary orbs like that!
sp51n2w1=Ay, look at all those evil eyes!
sp51n2w2=Ah!  It still creeps me out when one of those things wakes up!
sp63e=Starting to see a pattern here...
sp63n=Now this looks familiar...
sp63w=Dugan had better pay me for each of these rooms.
sp72n1w1=Jeebus!  The serpent must be about one thousand, four hundred and forty-five feet long!
sp72n1w2=But my contract says I'm not obliged to deal with any monster longer than one thousand, four hundred and forty-four.
sp72n1w3=Could just let this room be.
sp71n1e1=My blade won't scrape one scratch off that squirmy fellow.
sp71n1e2=But just lead him to a dead end, and I'll be rid of him.
sp84s1=Tar mothers, too?  Why, why, why...?
sp84s2=Every thirty turns tar mothers will make the tar grow by one tile in each direction.
sp84s3=It is relatively safe to be surrounded by growing tar, but you have to watch out for tar babies which might spawn during the growth.
sp83s1e=I hate tar mothers.
sp82s2e=Better be careful here... I can't get through if the tar clogs up that passage!
sp84s3e1=Never mind. Let's go!
sp84s3e2=And a wall here...
sp84s3e3=Good. At this rate, we'll be done mapping the level in a few minutes.
sp84s3e4=Do you hear that? It's the tar authority! We must hide!
sp84s3e5=Aaargh! I almost dropped the map!
sp84s3e6=Wait! Is the map facing the right way up?
sp85s2e1=This room... it looks... familiar... somehow...
sp85s2e2=It makes me feel... angry... and frustrated!
sp86s3e=Rats... I hope there aren't any sneaky tricks, like rooms hidden behind a secret wall somewhere!
sp88s3e1=Oh gob... this room is gonna give me nightmares...
sp88s3e2=Never again... never again...
spM1s=You have failed...
spT2=Turn your sword with `Q` and `W`.
spT3=Now go hit the orb with your sword.

spT6=Your objective in DROD is to clear each level of all monsters.
spT7=Hit the roach with your sword to kill it.

spT10=If you die or are in a situation where each move results with death, you can undo up to three moves with `Backspace`.
spT11=This potion will allow you to place a mimic. Mimics copy every move you make and they move immediately after you, but before monsters.
spT12=Place the mimic at the tile marked with a checkpoint below. Use it to drop all trapdoors and the red gate will open.
spT13=Congratulations, you have completed this room!
spT14=After you leave the room your success will be permanent. You will always be able to see your best score for the room, and you will be able to see how you've placed in comparison to the scores on the leaderboard.
spT15=If you have connected the game using valid Caravel forum account credentials, your best score will be submitted to the leaderboard.
spT16=Your score will remain on the leaderboard for two weeks unless you are a paid subscriber to CaravelNet, in which case your score will remain on the leaderboard forever.
spT17=You can now leave the tutorial room.
