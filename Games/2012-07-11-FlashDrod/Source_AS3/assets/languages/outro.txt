What will Beethro face next? Will the dangers become more hazardous? Will he manage to clean up the whole of King Dugan's Dungeon and finally get paid?

Congratulations!
You have completed the first episode in the Deadly Rooms Of Death, King Dugan's Dungeon Lite hold. I sincerely hope you have found this experience enjoyable.
Now that you have descended the final flight of stairs available in this set, you may want to try to Master, and then Post-Master, this game!  To do this, go hunt for secret rooms. The number of secret rooms left on each level is now displayed on the Restore Screen.
Once you manage to conquer them all, a special Mastery Area will be opened. Can you find how to access it?
You may also wish to play the next episode in the DROD:KDDL series.

Before I leave you to bathe in your feeling of utter glory, I'd like to thank a couple of people, without whom this game would have never seen the light of day:

Eric Hermansen - The creator, father and inventor of DROD. Without him, this unique game idea would have never occurred to anyone.
Mike Rimer - He coded most of DROD: JtRH and DROD: TCB singlehandedly. Thanks to the splendid codebase, making Flash DROD was pure pleasure.
Matt Schikore - Governor of the Caravel Forum website. Thanks to him, you can battle for the best score per room!
Hold architects - Jacob, Larrymurk, slimm_tom (obviously I have to replace these with the actual names)
Testers -
Voice Talents - Sten Ryanson

See you next time!
