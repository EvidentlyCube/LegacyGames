# Level Entrances
entr1=Beethro Budkin, fifth-generation professional dungeon exterminator, was hired by King Dugan to clear the king's multi-level dungeon of a large monster infestation.///
    Beethro charges by the room, and as a professional, he is contract-bound to clear all the monsters from each and every room in the dungeon to get paid.///
    The only weapon Beethro needs to do his job is a Really Big Sword, which will defeat almost any monster in a single hit.////
    -----////
    "I hope you're not going to charge me for the top level. I already have that cleaned up. Well, mostly." -King Dugan
entr2=Beethro's a bit rusty, but the next level should get him in good chopping form.
entr3="Hmm..." pondered Beethro. "So far, I see mostly roaches down here. This looks like a cake job."
entr4="I wish I had some more of those mimics down here with me!" said Beethro.  "It would go a lot quicker."
entr4Back=Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
entrMaster=Beethro descended the stairs, only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...////
    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.


# Scrolls

sc1e0=Use numerical keyboard or 789uiojkl to move around. Keys can be remapped from within the pause menu (escape).

For now just continue west.
sc1_1n1w1=Rotate your sword using `Q` and `W`.
sc1_1n1w2=Strike the orb with your sword to open doors in the room.
sc1_1n1w3=Some orbs toggle the yellow doors between their open and closed states.
sc1_2n1w1=You can find out what an orb does by clicking it with your mouse. Differently colored highlighted doors indicate the different effects.
sc1_2n1w2=Instead of toggling a yellow door, an orb might always open or close it.
sc1_3n1w1=Blue gates open once you conquer all the required rooms on a given level (floor).
sc1_3n1w2=Required rooms are marked with a red background on the minimap.
sc1_3n2w1=Current speech and hovering text can be skipped with the space bar.
sc1_3n2w2=Once you leave a room cleared of all monsters, it will be marked as conquered.
sc1_3n2w3=On the minimap, conquered rooms are marked with white as opposed to the unconquered ones which are red.
sc1_3n2w4=Conquer all the required rooms to open your way to the next level.

sc1_5n1w2=Most monsters when moving onto a corner diagonally will slide vertically if possible.
sc1_5n2w1=Remember that you can click an orb with the mouse to see what doors it affects.
sc1_5n2w2=Look out!  It's dangerous here.////
    If you make a mistake, hit `Backspace` in order to undo up to your last three moves.
sc1_5n2w3=You can also undo (and restart) when the death animation is playing!
sc1_5n2w4=Touching a checkpoint 'X' allows you to rewind to when you last stepped on it.///
    Hit `R` to restart the room or go back to the last checkpoint you have touched.
sc1_6n2w=A fine swordsman can defeat all the roaches without using the southern nook for cover!
sc1_6n3w1=Use the backswipe technique to get rid of the roach.
sc1_6n3w2=Place yourself on the green floor and make sure the roach stands on the sand tile directly north of you...
sc1_6n3w3=Place yourself on the green floor and make sure the roach stands on the sand tile directly south of you...
sc1_6n3w4=...then move northeast to kill it.
sc1_6n3w5=...then move southeast to kill it.

sc2_2n1=Did you know that you can hold Shift while performing any action to automatically follow it with its inverse?

sc2_1n1e=You shouldn't be so destructive.
sc2e=You may wish to clear the rooms to the north first.
sc2_1s3e1=You can prevent yourself from accidentally leaving a room by hitting `X` to lock it.
sc2_1s3e2=A small lock on the minimap indicates that a room is locked.
sc2_1s=Don't do it! It's obvious what will happen!
sc2_2s3e=Good timing makes things a lot easier.
sc3_3n=I must warn you about mimics. They are neither your friends nor your enemies--they simply like to move exactly as you do. Don't turn your back on them.
sc3_3n1e=All of the prisoners have been eaten by dungeon roaches, and I'm next! You can't pay me enough to work this job. I'm outta here!////
    -Prison Warden
sc3_2n=It is possible to get to this passage without reentering the room after you've conquered it.
sc3_1n1w=With the invisible potion they can't see you, but they can still smell you if you get close.
sc3_1e=Such a long walk. It almost seems unnecessary.
sc3_1s=The Eight Gates of Bill--a formidable puzzle indeed. It used to be a lot harder, but I can now inspect the orbs to see what they do.
sc3_2s1w=Here is something that I will tell you--whenever you see long and laborious paths, you should look for shortcuts.
sc3_2s1=Turn back! Did you know that in just the last year, dungeon-related deaths were up by 32 percent?
sc3_2s2=Face the facts--dungeon exploration is NOT safe, especially when combined with intoxicants.///
    -PADD (Parents Against Dungeon Deaths)
sc4_2n1e1=This is a master wall. It won't open until you conquer the hold and also all of its secrets.
sc4_2n1e2=In the original "King Dugan's Dungeon", this was a warp room which allowed you to skip a level or two.
sc4_1n1=Hint:////
    You don't need the mimic's help to fight the roaches at the entrance.
sc4_1n2=Hint:////
    Think hard to develop the very useful BACKSWIPING technique -- good for when there's a monster on each side of you!
sc4_2e=If you have good style, all 9 mimics will be lined up to the right of you.
scMe1=Harder versions of existing puzzles.
scMe2=Last words!
scMe3=Difficult, original rooms.

scM_1s7=Very nice, way to go!


# Speeches

sp1e0=Use the numerical keypad to move around.

sp1e2=Go north to continue.
sp1_3n2w1=Ah, the first roach of the dungeon!
sp1_3n2w2=Come to Beethro, roachburger-to-be!
sp1_3n2w3=A clean kill!  This job's gonna turn out great, I just know it!
sp1_6n2w=I coulda cleared those roaches without hiding in the alcove, but I feel lazy today.
sp1_6n3w1=You have found a secret room!
sp1_6n3w2=Find and conquer them all to gain access to a special master challenge area.
sp2_2e=That queen'll make tons of new roaches by the time I get to the orb and back!
sp2_1s1e1=Hey, a wraithwing!
sp2_1s1e2=All by himself too... that means I could be chasing him all over the room.
sp2_1s1e3=Wraithwings, unlike roaches, run away from Beethro and try to keep themselves at a distance of five tiles.
sp2_1s1e4=They are not as shy in bigger numbers, and won't hesitate to attack if they surround their prey.
sp2_2s2e1=Hmmm... can I kill off those queens before they dump eggs?
sp2_2s2e2=Argh... too slow!
sp2_2s2e3=Ha!  Easily.
sp2_2s3e1=I'm sure there was a cleaner way to take out these roach queens.
sp2_2s3e2=Now THAT was a fine piece of smitemitery.
sp3_3n1e=No prisoners left? This is gonna be a lonely job with no one to talk to...
sp3_2n=No kidding.
sp3_1n2w0=Yikes!  I think I need the potion this time!
sp3_1n2w1=Whew!  Now those queens won't lay their eggs unless I'm close to them!
sp3_1n2w2=That was a bit rough, but nothing a good delver like me can't handle!
sp3_1n2w3=Ha!  Nothing's too tough for this delver!
sp3_1n1w1=Hey, this is pretty neat!
sp3_1n1w2=I know I coulda cleared this room without being invisible, but it was still fun.
sp3_1n1w3=That wasn't so hard... I wonder why that potion is there?
sp3_1s=I coulda opened all the doors sooner than this.
sp3_3s1w1=This looks dangerous... some kind of trap...
sp3_3s1w2=After I strike the orb, I could clear this room without any sword-turning. Just to be skillful!
sp3_3s1w3=Well, I may have turned my sword, but at least I'm still alive!
sp3_3s1w4=Wow!  Somebody shoulda been here to see me.
sp4_2n1e=Another secret chamber where everyone but me least expects it.
sp4_1n1=I coulda cleared this room without going back to the entrance hallway.
sp4_1n2=Beethro Budkin surmounts any challenge!
sp4_2e1=Holy Hoobuffins! Maybe there is such a thing as too many mimics!
sp4_1s2e=Why is it that dropping every trapdoor makes a room look better?
spM_1s=You have failed...
