# Level Entrances
entr9=Beethro Budkin, fifth-generation professional dungeon exterminator, was hired by King Dugan to clear the king's multi-level dungeon of a large monster infestation.///
    Beethro charges by the room, and as a professional, he is contract-bound to clear all the monsters from each and every room in the dungeon to get paid.///
    The only weapon Beethro needs to do his job is a Really Big Sword, which will defeat almost any monster in a single hit.////
    -----////
    Beethro sat down on the steps for a break. He pulled three bottles out of his pack. The ten-cup bottle was filled with refreshing leaf juice, and the other two bottles, which were in two-cup and five-cup sizes, were empty. Beethro wanted to drink exactly four cups of leaf juice in one uninterrupted gulp. He started messing around with the cups, pouring juice from one to another and back, but after a while gave up.  "This is too much work!  Forget it!"
entr10=As many experienced dungeon exterminators know, beneath dwell some beasties that are able to blend into their surroundings.
entr11=Catching a glimpse of the room ahead, Beethro grunted in disapproval.  "I don't know how, but the tar always ends up that way, and I hate it."
entr12=Again, Beethro heard loud hissing below, and knew to expect serpents. But this time the sound was slightly different, and he stopped a moment to listen and judge what lay ahead. "Good Gob!  Those slitherbags must've been down there a gawdawful long time, with some big meals along the way."
entr12Back=Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
entrMaster=Beethro descended the stairs only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...////
    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.
entrTutorial=Tutorial
entrTutorialLeft=Beethro left the tutorial floor rich with new knowledge.

sc94n3e=The order is the key.
sc10e=Invisibly evil spiders lurk on this level. Beware, for they are hard to see.
sc111s2e=Psst... This passage takes you to the stairs. You might want to clear all other rooms before going there!
sc121n1e1=If a serpent moves west and it prefers horizontal movement, step to the east of its head to force it to move north.
sc121n1e2=It works the same vertically, but then the snake prefers eastward movement.
sc12e=Your clock tells you which direction snakes currently prefer. This will help you to control these erratic creatures.

scT5=`Escape` opens up the pause menu, where you can view `General Help` to refer to the controls anytime you wish.
scT6=To prevent yourself from accidentally leaving a room hit X to lock and unlock it. A small lock icon on the minimap indicates that a room is locked.

scT9=All keys can be remapped from within game options.
scT10=Those without CaravelNet subscriptions won't have their scores stored on the leaderboard but will know what place they would have attained.

scT13=Wraithwings, unlike roaches, run away from Beethro and try to keep themselves at a distance of five tiles.
scT14=They are not as shy in bigger numbers, and won't hesitate to attack if they surround their prey.
sc1_6n3w1=Use the backswipe technique to get rid of the roach.
sc1_6n3w2=Place yourself on the green floor and make sure the roach stands on the sand tile directly north of you...
sc1_6n3w3=Place yourself on the green floor and make sure the roach stands on the sand tile directly south of you...

sc1_6n3w5=...then move southeast to kill it.
sc1_6n3w6=Repeat to analyze the backswipe. Master this technique, for it will prove crucial in your further endeavours.

sp9e3=Move around using the numpad or 789, UIO, JKL
sp9e4=Hot griddled roaches!  No more tar!
sp91n1e=That was just nasty. Maybe tar isn't so bad after all...
sp94n4e1=Ah-ha!  Gotta get up early in the morning to pull one over on Beethro!
sp94n4e2=I am not amused.
sp93n=Hrm. This is a very strange door. I can't get through.
sp92n2e=A door I can't get through. I wonder what's on the other side.
sp11e1=And I really hate it when the tar grows so high above me... gives me the creeps.
sp11e2=Gah!  The tar's grown all the way over the walls!
sp111n1w=Hmm...it could be worse...could be a tar mother in here...
sp111n2w1=Guess I spoke too soon.
sp111n2w2=Looks like there's something else different about this room...

spT7=Hit the roach with your sword to kill it.

spT11=This potion will allow you to place a mimic. Mimics copy every move you make and move immediately after you, but before monsters.
spT12=Place the mimic at the tile marked with a checkpoint below. Use it to drop all trapdoors and the red gate will open.
spT13=Serpents can't be damaged by your sword but they will shrink to death if stuck at a dead end.

spT15=Try to keep in mind that the tarstuff can only be damaged on flat edges and any tile which is not stable will turn into tar babies.

spT17=Congratulations, you have completed this room!
