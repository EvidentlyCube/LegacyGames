# Welcome!
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Translation works in such way: [identificationName]=[translation]
# DO NOT modify the parts before "="
# \n is replaced by a new-line, \t is replaced by two spaces
# // at the end of the line allows you to continue the same line in the next:
#
# longText=Hello, this is a//
#   long line.
# will become:
# Hello, this is a long line.
# (notice that space was inserted after a, and the spaces before "long" were trimmed)
#
# /// does the same but inserts a line feed (so /// = \n//)
# //// doest the same but inserts two line feeds (so //// = \n/// = \n\n//)
#
# Sometimes you will encounter %%. This is a token which is replaced by something, for example number:
# score=You have scored %% points
# will become
# You have scored 1000 points
#
# You can freely move the %% around in the line

# If you have any questions just look around to see how everything looks already in the code

h&bText=\tDROD was conceived by Erik Hermansen back in the '90s. It is largely known as//
    a puzzle game in which you run around rooms in a dungeon, slaying monsters with//
    a Really Big Sword. How does this work?  You will see for yourself as soon as//
    you get around to playing the game.////
      \tFlash DROD is a port of the original DROD game. It uses the media found in the//
    newer DROD game engines that you can download to play on your computer from//
    CaravelGames.com.////
      \tThanks to integrated CaravelNet capabilities, besides just completing the//
    puzzles, players can compete with each other for high scores by completing each//
    room in the fewest moves possible.

    \tYour objective is to clear each level of King Dugan's Dungeon of monsters. This feat can//
    be accomplished using only your Really Big Sword™ and your wits. Each room is a separate//
    area that has to be cleared in a single session. Should you leave a room without completely//
    clearing it, it will be restored to its initial state when you return.

# Backstory
backstory1=\tBeethro Budkin strolled into the Grand Dining Chamber where King Dugan was finishing his massive morning meal.////
      \t"Away, foul commoner! You disrupt my digestion with your poor hygiene!" bellowed the King, with bits of pork and potatoes erupting from his mouth.////
      \t"But sir," protested Beethro, "you sent for me."////
      \tThe expression on the King's large face changed from anger to confusion to recognition to geniality in the space of two seconds.////
      \t"I really should have had you come in sooner," said King Dugan. "It's unbelievable! You let your guards eat their meals down in the dungeon, they spread crumbs all over the place, and all of a sudden the place is just swarming with giant cockroaches, not to mention goblins, serpents, evil eyes, and other nasty things. It's really gotten out of hand."////
      \tBeethro straightened with pride. "Not to fear. I am a trained professional from a long line of dungeon exterminators. I combine five generations of passed-down knowledge with the most state-of-the-art equipment to offer efficient extermination service at an affordable price."////
      \t"What kind of equipment do you use?"////
      \t"I've got a really big sword."
backstory2=\t"Good! When can you start?"////
      \t"As soon as we handle the details of payment. Here are my standard extermination fees. Just sign at the bottom." Beethro handed a contract to the King.////
      \t"These prices are outrageous! Is the privilege of honorable service to the Crown worth nothing these days?"////
      \t"I can leave."////
      \t"No, no, no. We need that dungeon cleared so that the prisoners can receive their torture in a clean and safe environment."////
      \t"Well, I'll give you a discount if you'll throw in a princess."////
      \t"You're ugly and you smell bad. None of my daughters will have you!"////
      \tBeethro shrugged. "Fair enough."////
      \tThe King signed at the bottom of the contract. "Right then. Let me show you to the entrance."
backstory3=\tAs he descended, Beethro reflected on the job he had taken. Dugan's Dungeon was exceptionally large and, going by the reports of past exterminators, ridiculously well suited to infestation. It had also been secretly expanded several times, to the dismay of the first person to clear it out, whose contract hadn't covered the possibility. (He'd only gotten paid for the parts he'd known about.)////
      \tSome said sinister forces were behind the expansion. The legend went that a king of past grew tired of his annoying young son and jokingly suggested that the lad go play in the castle dungeons. Taking his father seriously, the boy wandered deep into the dungeon chambers and was never found again. It was said that he did not perish, but lived the rest of his life in the dungeons by preference; that becoming a master of his new habitat, he learned all of the secrets of the underground world and formed alliances with the monsters that dwelt there, setting them to work creating new passageways and breeding better specimens of monster. He named himself the 'Neather, and schemed to rise from the dungeons to claim the throne when his powers were able.
backstory4=\tBeethro wasn't sure about all that. For starters, the royal throne wasn't what it had been, now that its power was mostly transferred to a parliament. Never mind the question of who would want to live underground, or how they'd befriend the creatures there, who weren't great conversationalists. But it was true that dungeons tended to be unnecessarily complicated and easily infested, and even sometimes grow without warning - no Dungeon Architect would say why, as a matter of honor - and this more than anything was what kept men like Beethro in work.////
      \tAnyway, an exterminator had plenty of more practical concerns, like the prolific and man-sized dungeon roach. The important thing in Beethro's mind was that he ought to make enough money and dead monsters on this job to finally retire from this thankless trade and open a restaurant.////
      \t"I'll call it 'Beethro's Roasted Roach Grill'!"

drodHistoryWidth=650
drodHistory=\t"Deadly Rooms of Death" (DROD) was first created by Erik Hermansen in the//
    '90s. The game was released by Webfoot and is known as `Webfoot DROD`, though this game is no longer//
    on sale and can't be legally distributed or obtained. Luckily, Erik was allowed to redevelop the game on his//
    own and so `Caravel DROD` was born in 2002.////
      \tThen, in 2003, "DROD: Architect's Edition" was//
    released, featuring a level editor that allowed everyone to create their own `holds`//
    (level sets) and share them publicly on the CaravelGames forum. The game garnered a large//
    fanbase and a plan to create another game was conceived.////
      \tOn April 1, 2005, "DROD: Journey to Rooted Hold" was released! The list of new features added//
    was amazing. It featured new graphics, in-game scripting, over a dozen new game elements, a//
    captivating story and an antagonist whose voice sent chills down everyone's spine.////
      \tExactly two years later "DROD: The City Beneath" saw the light of the day. That day set a//
    record for the most active users on the Caravel Forum at one time. TCB featured even more new//
    elements and improvements over JtRH, and an increased difficulty level.////
      \tIn 2008, "DROD RPG" came out. Though not as popular as the mainstream titles, it was still a shining//
    gem. The big difference was that the game was a resource-managing multi-room strategic challenge.//
    Each monster had stats and you had to calculate what monsters could be defeated at a given moment, plan//
    where to go next, which resources to collect, and when and how to get them.////
      \t"DROD 4: Gunthro and the Epic Blunder" is the latest installment, released on the 1st of April 2012. This//
    game is aimed at new players, and is much more beginner-friendly because of easier puzzles, more intuitive tutorials//
    and more obvious hub levels.
