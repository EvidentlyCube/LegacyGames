Now you are going to play a V 0.3 Alpha release of my project D.R.O.S.
(Doomed Roads Of Skellhood) This project is based on D.R.O.D.
(www.drod.net). If you dont know how to play this game, please 
download DROD cause I dont have time
and patience to descript all this things.
Controls:
Numpad 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 - Moving
Numbad 5 - Wait
Q - Turn sword 45 Left
W - Turn sword 45 Right
R - Reloads last save point
F2 - Restarts room
I wish you luck!
Press Any key to continue...


2024 addendum:
 - Use 789 / UIO / JKL to move when Numpad is not available
 - Press 'd' on this screen to enable debug mode:
   - Teleport with LMB
   - 'k' to kill all enemies
   - '1' and '2' to change weapons (second weapon
     can rotate 90 degrees with 'a' and 's')
 - There are bugs with checkpoints where doors reclose, sorry, not gonna fix it
 - Your completion progress is saved but not progress in a room
 - Otherwise I left everything as-is, including the cringy
   text above.
