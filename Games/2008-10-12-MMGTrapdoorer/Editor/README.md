# MMG Trapdoorer editor
The editor was written in Blitzmax.


# Editor.exe
There is a compiled build of the editor included in a ZIP archive hidden behind a password.
The password is there to avoid triggering antivirus software - I take no responsibility for the
safety of the executable. If you're worried it might be infected please don't use it
or run it on a machine you're fine with getting infected.

The password to unzip the built editor is:

Editor.exe
