# Notice
I am fully aware this game uses Nintendo's assets. I made it 15 years ago and
the reason I want it here is because I want this repository to be a complete
collection of my works and I want the source code to be available.

If you're Nintendo you can reach out to me through me@evidentlycube.com

# DevelopmentUnlike other projects I chose to not clean up the code of this project at all.
It's exactly as it was 15 years ago from today with the sole exception of adding
the display modes and default fullscreen for better experience while playing.


## Project Structure
 - `Source_FLA/` ⟶ The <GAME / PROTOTYPE>'s sources in the form of an `.fla` file
    and other source files
 - `SWF/` ⟶ A compiled `.swf` file of the <GAME / PROTOTYPE>
 - `play-win.bat` ⟶ A windows batch file that runs the SWF file in
   a bundled flash player
 - `play-linux.sh` ⟶ A shell script that runs the SWF file in
   a bundled flash player
 - `archive_filelist.txt` ⟶ Contents listing of the archive that contained the
   source code, with file modification dates


## Changes from the original
 - Added full screen, scaling and quality options


## Trivia
 - The release date is estimated based on the creation date of the SWF file
   that was in the archive I had for the project.
 - The game was commissioned by Softendo
