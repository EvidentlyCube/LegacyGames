# Development
## Project Structure
 - `Source_GM6/` ⟶ The original GM6 project files
 - `Source_GMStudio1.4/` ⟶ Conversion of the latest version to GM Studio 1.4
 - `Source_GMStudio2024/` ⟶ Latest version ported to GM Studio 2024
 - `archive_filelist.txt` ⟶ Contents listing of the archive that contained the
   source code, with file modification dates


## Changes from the original
 - GMStudio 2024 build has the music disabled because the old .dlls do not work
   and their code was commented out.


## Trivia
 - The controls key is "G" because I was a teenager with a teenage sense of
   humour when I made this game.
