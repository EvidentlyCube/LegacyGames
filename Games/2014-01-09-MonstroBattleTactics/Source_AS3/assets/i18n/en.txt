# Welcome!
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Translation works in such way: [identificationName]=[translation]
# DO NOT modify the parts before "="
# \n is replaced by a new-line, \t is replaced by two spaces
# // at the end of the line allows you to continue the same line in the next:
#
# longText=Hello, this is a//
#   long line.
# will become:
# Hello, this is a long line.
# (notice that space was inserted after a, and the spaces before "long" were trimmed)
#
# /// does the same but inserts a line feed (so /// = \n//)
# //// doest the same but inserts two line feeds (so //// = \n/// = \n\n//)
#
# Sometimes you will encounter %%. This is a token which is replaced by something, for example number:
# score=You have scored %% points
# will become
# You have scored 1000 points
#
# You can freely move the %% around in the line
#
# If you have any questions just look around to see how everything looks already in here
#
# So to, translate a line simply replace everything that is after the equality sign with the translation, eg:
#
# someIdentifier=This is text to translate.
# to:
# someIdentifier=To jest tekst do przetlumaczenia.

plot_text_1=Ludus is a peaceful land where ancient terror beasts and humans//
    somehow coexist in perfect harmony. Absolute bliss and peace govern their//
    lives, and any reasonable person would consider Ludus a pretty nifty place//
    to live, terror beasts and all.
plot_text_2=But such joy and laughter can never last forever, because that//
    would be boring. So, once every few hundred years or so, a predictably//
    unpredictable astrological phenomenon occurs wherein some angry people//
    in the sky from a not-sky-at-all dimension called Terra come and shred//
    their eternal peace to pieces. Who knows why, they're probably picked on or something.
plot_text_3=Whenever they arrive, a fleet of floating islands are brought along.//
    Their fields, divided into conveniently perfect squares, make up the//
    battlefields where the humans and the ancient terror beasts battle//
    for the amusement of these angry sky people.
plot_text_4=Its pretty darn awful. The peaceful terror beasts dont really enjoy//
    being terrifying, and the puny humans dont really enjoy being puny, but when//
    the alternative is getting sky-peopled to death (it's bad),the result is//
    friends killing friends and innocent terror beasts alike, hoping for the//
    battles to end and for peace to return to the land.

outro.human_0.text=Having no choice but to stab and perforate the mostly-docile-but-totally-not-when-angry Terror Beasts to the brink of extinction, the humans now reflect on the somewhat melancholy advent of The First New Era Ever, and would thrive marvellously with human supremacy and progress, if the whole thing just wasn't so sad.
outro.human_1.text=The blood everywhere, and the bleating of the suffering, decimated ranks of the usually-friendly Terror Beasts is kind of a killjoy, let's face it.
outro.human_2.text_a=Congratulations for completing Human Campaign!////
	Human++ has been unlocked - 20 new and challenging missions just for you. You could of course do Monsters first which I recommend, but my job is not to tell you how to live your life.
outro.human_2.text_b=Congratulations for completing Human Campaign!////
	Wait wait, do I see right? You did Monster first? That's kinda... Splendid! I see you like to think out of the box, or at the very least your thoughts are out of order. Human++ was already unlocked so I don't have anything else to say to you, sorry.
outro.human_2.text_c=Congratulations for completing Human Campaign!////
	It smells like someone who doesn't particularly care about doing the first thing first. No, wait, it's just me. Anyway, Monster++ is now available for you to suffer through. I mean to enjoy! Damn those typos.

outro.monster_0.text=So Ancient Terror Beasts are really terrifying when someone convinces them that using terror is a pretty solid plan to get out of a nasty situation. Turns out getting poked with a spear enough generally does the trick. Those silly humans never stood much of a chance.
outro.monster_1.text=There was a fair amount of chomping and crunching sounds, a few squishy and goopy sounds, but mostly, there was just the shrieking and crying sounds of manliness being bitten in half and bravery being stomped on.
outro.monster_2.text=After the great battle, the Ancient Terror Beasts calmed down and gazed upon the remains of the Puny Humans who were the same Friend Humans that once frolicked the land alongside them. And now they were all squished and stuff. The Ancient Terror Beasts, not being terribly bright, didn't put two and two together, however, and carried on being terrifying without a care in the world.
outro.monster_3.text_a=Congratulations for completing Monster Campaign!////
	Is there something wrong with humans in your opinion? I know, I know. I myself think the monsters are much cuter (have you seen goos and their little smiles?) Given the choice I'd do the same. Human++ has been unlocked but how about you give the regular human campaign a chance first?
outro.monster_3.text_b=Congratulations for completing Monster Campaign!////
	Alright, alright. You jumped from Human Campaign straight to this one, very good! There isn't any benefit for doing it the default way aside from the artificial satisfaction of the virtual narrator (me!) but I am grateful! Good luck with Human++!
outro.monster_3.text_c=Congratulations for completing Monster Campaign!////
	So, you did Monsters last? Do you perhaps dislike them? No, wait, I know! You must love them so much that you wanted to experience leading them for as long as you could without a stop, that must be it! Well then wait no more, Monster++ has been unlocked for you!

outro.human_hard_0.text=The humans and Ancient Terror Beasts have been doing this a long time, but the humans actually have pretty neat brains and came up with a plan. The great philosophers of pretentious literature, micro-sustainability, pseudo-economics, Skygod Pantheon Guesswork History, smoke-and-mirror techniques, sacrificial mathematics, and rigged contest studies all totally know what they're doing.
outro.human_hard_1.text=They managed to kill just enough of their friends, the Terror Beasts, to be entertaining and make those stupid Skygods go away. Hey, it beats total and utter eradication any day. Until next time!
outro.human_hard_2.text_a=Congratulations for completing Human++ Campaign!////
	It seems you decided to go out of order and left Monster Campaign for later. That's a very fair choice, considering Monster and Human levels have a lot in common. But you can't delay it any further. Monster++ can only be unlocked if you finish all the other campaigns first.
outro.human_hard_2.text_b=Congratulations for completing Human++ Campaign!////
	I see you like humans. Is there any chance it was caused by the fact that you are human yourself? I just want to ensure you that you should not fear monsters, they're a fuzzy, funny and fairly fantastic flock of forthright fuddles!
outro.human_hard_2.text_c=Congratulations for completing Human++ Campaign!////
	You rushed through the missions in the default order you say? That's a fantastic choice! This way the difficulty curve had fewer bumps along the way. Now that Monster++ is unlocked prepare for the final and most challenging challenges, challenger!

outro.monster_hard_0.text=As it turns out, to everyone's complete surprise, Ancient Terror Beasts are actually conservationists and extremely clever, but it's purely on instinct, so they have no idea they're being clever which leads to some tricky classifications of intelligence but whatever. Ancient Terror Beasts actually like Puny Humans.
outro.monster_hard_1.text=They think they're funny and smell weird and Terror Beasts are all about weird smells. However, Skygods smell like cinnamon and Terror Beasts know better than to trifle with spicy overlords so some Puny Humans maybe kinda needed to get squished so that cinnamon smell would go away, and go away they did.
outro.monster_hard_2.text=But the Terror Beasts, true to their nature, made sure not to squish too many Puny Humans, because Terror Beasts need puny friends, too.

outro.finale_0=Congratulations, Playgod! Thanks to you, the predictably unpredictable astrological phenomenon could occur, so that the puny humans and the ancient terror bests had a chance to...///
 	Actually let's cut this off while it's still funny.  As you probably have guessed already, Skygods are a metaphor for level designers and Playgods for the players.
outro.finale_1=It's 10PM, Novemeber 23 when I am writing this. 10 days before Monstro ships on Steam and there is a lot of work left to do. We're missing 80 level descriptions, no achievement has been coded and Steam trading cards have no art yeet.//
 	The last three weeks of the development so far were a gigantic crunch - every free hour I spent on fixing bugs and adding new features. I am fairly sure I've done more wprl in this short amount of time than in the past year.//
 	Was it worth it? Only my future self will know. And you, because if you've got this far it means you've enjoyed the game, which is one of the main reasons why it was even created in the first place.
outro.finale_2=Making Monstro was probably more pain than joy considering that the first release of the game at the beginning of 2014 was a total failure, less than 20 units sold in two years.//
	It was very disheartening so we left the project on Steam Greenlight without much hope it'll ever be greenlit. When over a year later the information that it actually passed reached me I was angry and disappointed//
	instead of happy, because it meant wasting more time on a dead game.
outro.finale_3=But after some thinking we decided to give releasing it a try! At first the plan was to leave it as is, then we decided to change this and that and, in the end, almost every part of the game was at least slightly modified.//
	If you ever wonder how the old release compares to this one search Newgrounds or Kongregate for Monstro, if I didn't remove the old demos by the time you read this.
outro.finale_4=Enough of my ranting! I'd like to take the time to give the due credit to people who helped with the creation of this game:

tut.step_6=If you select a unit you can move your mouse///
           over the stats window to see what each of them does.
tut.step_7=Now attack the slime.
tut.step_8=Its defense restored! Did you see it? This is a core mechanic///
           in Monstro and it happens at the beginning of unit's turn.///
           You'll need the help of the soldier to get past the slime's defenses.///
           Should you get stuck, use the undo feature (key: Q).////
           (Click to dismiss)

tut.step_9=Traps spring only when a unit stands on them, it is safe to pass through.///
  		   A web trap will stun a unit for a whole turn, while the///
  		   pit and spike traps deal a certain amount damage.
tut.step_10=That wasn't the most fortunate move.///
			Undo (key: Q) back to the beginning and keep a closer eye on the floor,///
			it hints which spaces are safe.
tut.step_11=There is one very important pattern that enemies always follow.///
            They prefer to attack from the sides, so given equal choice they'll///
            try to move vertically and stand to the left or right of your unit.////
            (Click to dismiss)

tut.step_12=You, and only you, can take fake///
			walls down to open new passages.
tut.step_13=But was it a good choice? Be quick as wasting too many///
			turns in this mission will result in a failure!////
		   (Click to dismiss)

tut.step_14=Sometimes keeping your distance is the best option, especially///
			that you are not allowed to lose any unit in this mission.
tut.step_15=A shroom came into the archer's range! Shoot it quickly and///
			don't worry about the walls, they don't block ranged attacks!////
			(Click to dismiss)

tut.step_16=Mobile walls give a tremendous tactical advantage especially when accompanied///
			by a ranged unit. They are invulnerable and act as a wall for enemies,///
			while still allowing your units to pass through them without any problem.////
			(Click to dismiss)

tut.step_17=The little icon below your///
			unit is a specialization.
tut.step_18=Specializations modify units' stastistics. There are///
			eight different specializations in the game and///
			a unit can have up to three of them.///
			Just don't stand around, run for the brain or else the shrooms will kill you!////
			(Click to dismiss)

tut.step_19=This is the last mission in the Introduction campaign.///
			Afterwards you'll be all on your own. If you ever feel lost check the help (F1)///
			where you can find explanation of all the mechanics in the game, including///
