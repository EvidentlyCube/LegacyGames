# Mario Forever Flash editor

The editor was written in Blitzmax.

# LevelEditor.zip

There is a compiled build of the editor included in a ZIP archive hidden behind a password.
The password is there to avoid triggering antivirus software - I take no responsibility for the
safety of the executable. If you're worried it might be infected please don't use it
or run it on a machine you're fine with getting infected.

The password to unzip the built editor is:

# How to use

I don't know, you'll have to figure it out by yourself. The source code is in
`Main.bmx` so that should be a good starting point.

# There are no levels

Yes, unfortunately it seems the levels I had in the repository for this project
were actually Squario levels. My theory is that when I was making the MFF ones
I never saved the levels to disk, only immediately exported them to the game's
text format.
