# Hi!

ðŸš§ðŸš§ **Heavily under constrcution!** ðŸš§ðŸš§

This repository contains all of the non-commercial games I've released in the past ideally with as much of the source code and assets as I could find. Each project has its own `README.md` which adds more context.

## DROS

* [Source Code](https://github.com/EvidentlyCube/LegacyGames/tree/main/2005-DROS)
* [Download Game](https://cdn.evidentlycube.com/games/DROS.zip) - Windows / Linux (Wine)

An attempt to make my own version of DROD in Game Maker, from 2005.

# Playing the games

Every game in this repository can be played - finished and significant projects
have their binaries available on EvidentlyCube.com while prototypes have either
binaries in this repository or can be run directly through Flash Player.

Each project's `README.md` has instruction on how to run/play it.

## Getting Flash Player

 - If you checked out this repository do one of the following:
   - **If you have node.js installed:** run the command `npm run init`
   - **Otherwise:** `git submodule update --init --recursive`
 - Otherwise do these steps:
   1. Download the repository from https://github.com/EvidentlyCube/flash-player-archive
   2. Unpack its contents into `libs/flash-players`.
   3. Make sure the root of the downloaded repository is inside there, the path
      to the readme file should be `libs/flash-players/README.md`
