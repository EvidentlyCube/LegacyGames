# Mominis Trapdoorer (Android)

 - **Original Release Date:** January 15, 2012 (Likely earlier though)
 - **Status:** Finished
 - **Technology:** MoMinis game editor

## About
Move off trapdoors to drop them and drop every single one of them in a stage
to complete it.

This game was commissioned by Mominis, a now defunct company. They released
a game creation tool for mobile games.

## How to play the game
I don't know!

There is an `apk` of the game available in `APK/` but it is not tested whether
it works anymore or not. It might not work on modern versions of Android and
require an emulation.

# Development

## Project Structure
 - `APK/` ⟶ The Android's APK file for the game sourced from the internet.
 - `Media/` ⟶ Social media and web assets, sourced from the internet
 - `Sources/` ⟶ All the available source files I still have of the game.

## Trivia
 - The game was commissioned by Mominis.
 - The game was created with the game maker tool created by Mominis.
 - The original project files are lost though given that the tool
   itself is also no longer available it makes little difference.
 - The game was most likely released in either 2011 or 2010 but I have no
   way to verify the exact dates.
 - Graphics were made by Aleksander Kowalczyk (Cage).
